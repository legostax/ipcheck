# ipcheck
Kodi addon for checking the external IP address

Just compress the `script.ipcheck` folder into a .zip file and install it into Kodi. Should work flawlessly after that.

I have no plans to add more features now that the basic functionality is ironed out. All types of pull requests are welcome!
